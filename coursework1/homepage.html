<h2>Synopsis</h2>
  <p class="synopsis">Their are many stories in the world of music but not many can even touch the journey of Joy Division
  front man and visionaire Ian Curtis. From a glam rock to punk rock obbsessive, to then becoming the leader of the new wave/post punk/goth movemnts is an interesting CV.
  Born in Maccelsfiled and then moving further into Manchester, Ian always wanted to be a rockstar, he would meet some like minded people and they call themslevs Joy Division (named after a brothel used by
  German soldiers in WW2) which gave them a name for being Nazis, which was untrue. Things looked good but after an unexpected fit on the way back from a gig Ian is diganosed with an illness and his life is never the same again,
  what ensuees is a heartbreaking take of a genuis who wasnt given the help he needed, he made mistakes and alos made some of the ebst music the past century has ever seen. But now people just steal his headstone.
  The headstone in question simply read Love will tear us apart.</p>
