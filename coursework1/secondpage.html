        <p class="sam 2">Sam Riley takes the lead role of frontman Ian Curtis in the film. In his first major role he takes centre stage as the his portrayl
        of the mentraly ill Ian will bring a tear to the most hardened film viewer. Not only does he look spookly a like to the man himslef put he has also captured his manurisms
      to perfection. Whetehr its the way he smokes a cigerate, walks with a trech coat, or even how he potrays the deancing Ian used to do which was a mimic of the fits he used to endure due
       to the drugs he was being forced to take for his illness, and from when he once wittnessed an epleptic girl have a fit. That event also inspired the song "shes lost control".</p>

        <p class="samantha 2">Samantha Morton plays the wife of Ian Curtis, Debbie Curtis. A seasoned actress she brings her A game to the role and envlops the personbality of Debbie. Most likely due to the fact
        the real Debbie wrote a book all about her experiences from this time called "touching from a distance", no doubt a bible for Samantha when reaserching the role. She plays a paitent woman, one who lovs her husband
      who just wants him to be happy, but as the film portrays, she ends up humilated and heart broken, its not a happy story, not many in rock n roll are. But the difference for Debbie story compard to most in
    the fact she surveived it, she lived to tell the tale. Samamtha has met with her a few times to discuss the role and emtions to portray.</p>
